## Funded Casino
- Colonists now play for funding at the casino
- Gamblers and tourists bet more
- Sanity penalty and casinos suspend operations if you run out of funding
- Choose who gambles at your casinos

### Description:
Your colonists now play roulette at the casinos with real funding. While they have no need of funding on Mars, their friends and families certainly do back on earth!

If run out of funding and are not able to pay a lost bet, the colonist will take sanity damage and your casinos will suspend operation until funding is restored. Casinos automatically restore operation when funding is above 10M.

Gamblers bet at higher odds and tourists bet more. Gamblers also take more sanity damage if they are not paid.

Beware genius colonists!
